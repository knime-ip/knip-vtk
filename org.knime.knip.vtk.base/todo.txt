Bugs to fix:

    PreRender end (x502) Invalid Operation
    Is an opengl bug, coming from the vktOpenGlGPUVolumeRayCastMapper. Seems
    that there is some operation performed that should not be! Vanishes if one
    comments out the line removing the volumes from the Renderer. So far only
    seen in Kubuntu.
    One can force the bug to appear by using the GPU instead of the SMART Mapper
    in the Volume.java class.
    happens if a prop is removed and then later readded to the view
    test: see if this also happens if we do not destroy the opengl context

    on windows only:
    image is rendered correctly on init, but then overdrawn by some higher call
    from SWING with background color. Questing asked on lwjgl forums.


Features still missing:

    move multiple tfs at once
    overview of image dims etc, as in Table Cell Viewer
    add the camera icon to the screenshots

    more efficient reading from the arrays

Request:
